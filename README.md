# Fluid Catalytic Cracking

In my senior year of college, I worked alongside Jameel Hammad, Slah Yehya, and Christian Pena on a chemical process simulation design project. The objective was 
to model the processing of gas oil in a fluid catalytic cracking unit. Our group utilized Aspen Plus, a leading chemical process simulation tool. This software comes with 
an extensive component database, standard unit operations (gas compressors, liquid pumps, reactor models, etc.), process optimization tools, and more. Our process 
simulation was developed by referencing various literature sources (academic journal articles, handbooks, textbooks, and commercial/governmental websites). Here's a brief overview:

The simulation converts gas oil (GO) to commodity products such as dry gas (DG), liquified petroleum gas (LPG), gasoline (GLN), light cycle oil (LCO), and slurry. GO is 
processed at a rate of 1,604,448 gal/day and converted to produce petroleum products at varying capacities: DG at 3,717,792 gal/day, LPG at 324,864 gal/day, 
GLN at 648,000 gal/day, LCO at 251,424 gal/day, and slurry at 67,392 gal/day. The simulation yields of DG, GLN, LPG, LCO, coke, and slurry are 5.9 wt. %, 48.5 wt. %, 
15.8 wt. %, 17.9 wt. %, 7.9 wt. %, and 4.0 wt. %, respectively. Overall, simulation yields are consistent with product yields commonly reported in industry. The conversion of gas 
oil is approximately 95 wt. % and the riser residence time 2.71 seconds. A catalyst-to-oil ratio of 6.4 was employed. The total depreciable cost of this process is $135 million. 
The annual capital cost was calculated to be $45 million per year. The cost of raw materials is $2.2 million per day and the calculated revenue is $2.4 million per day. 
The project ROI was calculated as 3.68 % with a payback period of 4.6 years.
